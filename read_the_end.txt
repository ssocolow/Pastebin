A soporific lull began to cause the project of terraforming Hamabath-2 to languish.  The time had come where no more work was called for -- only patience.  But who likes waiting around?  Some inhabitants grew constantly somnolent; few remained vigilant.  With all the newfound free time they felt free and unpressured -- and bored.  The waiting time the plan called for was faster than geological timescales; unfortunately, it was slower than biological timescales.  But society gradually acquiesced to the plan.  They would have to wait their whole lives, and so would their children, for something they and their forefathers had worked so hard for.  You would think these people would know their long term plan by heart.  But they preferred to live day by day, because life can be easier this way.  Their days filled with whatever they wanted to do, but for some reason it wasn’t fulfilling.  What if your goal in life was to make a lot of money and then do whatever you want?  That was mine.  But maybe, after I make a lot of money and then go to do whatever I want, I find that it actually isn’t that fulfilling?  Maybe I just saved myself 20 years and a lot of time and misplaced effort.  Life is long and arduous, yet short and fleeting.  Live in the moment, man, because that’s the only place you’ll ever be.
